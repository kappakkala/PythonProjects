The project reads data from an influx measurement, passes it to a pandas dataframe and writes the same to a postgres table. The postgres table settings such as database, schema and table names are specified in `__init__.py`. To run the project, create `main.py` outside the project dir and a class object inside by running `influxpg.Influxpg(settings)`, where settings are imported from the settings module.
