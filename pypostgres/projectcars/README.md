The project creates a database, schema and a table as specified in `__init__.py`. Running the project inserts data into a table, executes a query and prints the table data from a pandas dataframe object. The project is implemented using both psycopg2 and SQLAlchemy. To run the project using psycopg2, create a class object by running `pypsycopg.Carpsyco()`. To execute the same using SQLAlchemy, create an object `pysqlalchemy.Caralchemy()`.
